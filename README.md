**Abstract:** Regional social, environmental, and economic systems form a rich web of connections that both
create opportunities and pose risks. Regional economies, characterized by their
interconnectedness across jurisdictional boundaries, might be better managed at a transboundary
scale since they can leverage a broad resource pool and greater economic diversity compared to a
single jurisdiction alone. The technical challenge is to identify which economies are connected
and could be managed collectively to better mitigate, absorb, and recover from disruptions.
Economic risk management often occurs at the state level, but network approaches can identify
groups that interact with one another based on actual commodity flows, capturing important
features of the system that are not currently coordinated. One such approach, based on ecological
theory, is to identify economic metacommunities. This paper uses theories and methods from
metacommunity ecology to identify overarching structures in the Western U.S. trade network.
Specifically, we construct commodity flow networks for 25 metro and rural areas, then assess
these using the ecological concepts of interaction strength, diversity, clusters, and sources and
sinks to identify 5 economic metacommunities. Based on metacommunity membership, we
answer the question: Which regions in the Western USA are interdependent, and are
interdependent regions spatially proximate or not? These results are useful in economic
development and infrastructure planning for developing redundancy, targeting vulnerable
interdependencies, and understanding potential risks from adverse policy exposure.
